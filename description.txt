Are you sick of your companions, settlers, brahmin, or even visiting traders and their brahmin getting stuck on roofs?  Of course, you are!  Don't you wish you could make them get the fudge down?  Sure, you do!  The Mighty Sniper Rifle of GTFD will solve your problem.  Just point and shoot from the location you would prefer the badly-behaved NPC be located!

The Mighty Sniper Rifle of GTFD provide a sniper rifle (by default) and several other weapon options which are available through the holotape (named [Settings] Get the Fudge Down for VIS-compatibility.)  Each of these weapons needs their own ammo which is invisibly added to your inventory in large quantities when you switch weapons with the holotape or unequip and reequip a GTFD weapon.  No more going back to the holotape every ten rounds!

GTFD weapons only work on non-hostile NPCs.  They deal a trivial amount of damage in order to apply their effect and are non-hostile.  The holotape and weapons are quest items and therefore have no weight and cannot be accidentally dropped.  The ammo has no weight whatsoever.

GTFD requires AWKCR (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091) and is VIS-compatible (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3877) because you should already have these mods installed as part of de-consolifying the UI with DEF_UI (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10654).  GTFD bundles Vault 111 Exit Detector (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21858), Holotape Retainer (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21860), and Chronicle (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31601) so that you do not need to install them separately.
